# JSatisfactorySaveLoader
A Java library to load/save Satisfactory save files

This library is based heavily on the excellent work done by the guys over at https://github.com/Goz3rr/SatisfactorySaveEditor
The inital build is being done based on the 'newer_parser' at commit 4e7ae94 https://github.com/Goz3rr/SatisfactorySaveEditor/tree/4e7ae9477ada4abb1f81283c78812c6ae9e223f9
